            <h2>What is Recursion?</h2>
            <p>In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. The approach can be applied to many types of problems, and recursion is one of the central ideas of computer science.</p>

            <h2>Recursion in Programming Languages</h2>
            <p>Most computer programming languages support recursion by allowing a function to call itself from within its own code. Some functional programming languages, such as Clojure, do not define any looping constructs but rely solely on recursion to repeatedly call code. It is proved in computability theory that these recursive-only languages are Turing complete, meaning they are as powerful as imperative languages based on control structures such as while and for.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Recursive Functions and Algorithms</h2>
            <p>A common algorithm design tactic is to divide a problem into sub-problems of the same type as the original, solve those sub-problems, and combine the results. This is often referred to as the divide-and-conquer method. When combined with a lookup table that stores the results of previously solved sub-problems to avoid redundant computation, it is referred to as dynamic programming or memoization.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Base Case</h2>
            <p>A recursive function definition has one or more base cases, meaning input(s) for which the function produces a result trivially (without recurring), and one or more recursive cases, meaning input(s) for which the program recurs (calls itself). The base case prevents the function from running indefinitely and is sometimes called the "terminating case."</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Recursive Data Types</h2>
            <p>Recursion is also used for representing data whose exact size is unknown to the programmer. There are two types of self-referential definitions: inductive and coinductive definitions.</p>
